CatBoost v4 — Interpretability & Hybridization (v3-lite based)
== CV Results ==
CatBoost RMSLE: 0.14430
Hybrid   RMSLE: 0.14526

== What drives price (top features) ==
- TotalSF: mean |SHAP| = 0.0760
- OverallQual: mean |SHAP| = 0.0469
- GrLivArea: mean |SHAP| = 0.0349
- ExterQual_ord: mean |SHAP| = 0.0276
- OverallCond: mean |SHAP| = 0.0240
- Neighborhood: mean |SHAP| = 0.0226
- LotArea: mean |SHAP| = 0.0196
- Fireplaces: mean |SHAP| = 0.0148
- BsmtFinSF1: mean |SHAP| = 0.0140
- Age: mean |SHAP| = 0.0140

Actionable: Concentrate V5 on the top 5–10 features. Try explicit crosses and regime-aware models where PDPs show thresholds.

== Important interactions (pairs) ==
- GrLivArea_to_TotalSF × MSSubClass: interaction = 90.0000
- BathsPerRoom × MSSubClass: interaction = 90.0000
- BathsPerRoom × MSSubClass: interaction = 89.0000
- RemodAge × MSSubClass: interaction = 89.0000
- GrLivArea_to_TotalSF × MSSubClass: interaction = 89.0000
- RemodAge × MSSubClass: interaction = 88.0000
- Age × MSSubClass: interaction = 88.0000
- BathsPerRoom × MSSubClass: interaction = 88.0000
- GrLivArea_to_TotalSF × MSSubClass: interaction = 88.0000
- TotalSF × MSSubClass: interaction = 87.0000

Actionable: In V5, add engineered crosses for these pairs, or train a small residual model using just these interactions.

== PDPs inspected ==
TotalSF, OverallQual, GrLivArea, ExterQual_ord, OverallCond, Neighborhood

== Suggested V5 directions ==
1) Learn blending weights via stacking (replace fixed alpha with meta-learner on CatBoost+Linear(+Lasso)).
2) Residual modeling on top features/interactions (LightGBM/MLP) to capture leftover nonlinearity.
3) Regime splits if PDP shows saturation (e.g., GrLivArea > 3000) and fit per-regime models.
4) Uncertainty: multi-seed CatBoost ensemble to estimate prediction intervals.
5) Target-aware calibration for luxury tail where residuals skew.
